## Ansible
Ansible is a configuration management tool. In this Lab, we will use Ansible to install packages on the staging server we provisioned using Terraform.

Ansible will automate the process of one having to manually ssh into each server to install various packages like apache web server, node, mysql etc.

In our example, we will configure an Ansible Playbook to install apache web server on the provisioned VM instance.

### Install Ansible
SSH into your Lab VM instance. Run the commands below to install Ansible.

    # Update packages
    sudo apt update

    # Install ansible
    sudo apt install ansible -y


### Setting Up the Inventory File
The inventory file contains information about the hosts youâ€™ll manage with Ansible. You can include anywhere from one to several hundred servers in your inventory file, and hosts can be organized into groups and subgroups. 

    sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Add the following code sections to the end of the file

    [webservers]
    server1 ansible_host=<server-ip-address-from-terraform>
    server1 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<path-to-your-key-file.pem>

    [all:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

Whenever you want to check your inventory, you can run:

    ansible-inventory --list -y


### Pinging the Server
To ensure that ansible can connect to the hosts configured in the inventory, we have to ping the server. Run the command below to ping the server. 

    ansible all -m ping -u azureuser


## Ansible Playbook

    cd ~
    mkdir playbooks
    cd playbooks

    # Create a simple web site to display welcome to the DevOps class!
    echo "Welcome to the DevOps Class!" > index.html

    # Create ansible playbook to install apache web server.
    nano install-apache.yaml
